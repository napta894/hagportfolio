                                            To understand better the user experience when shopping online, I made a detailed <b>Experience Mapping</b> where I 
                                            identified opportunities to solve the problem.
                                            <br><br>

                                            Next, to help better emphasise with users I defined <b>Users stories</b> where I broaden it into 28 stories and 3 epics based on 
                                            the persona and the experience mapping. <br><br>
                                            The three main epics are <b>searching for organic cosmetic products, organic products label transparency and Shopping experience.</b>

                                        After authoring user stories, I selected the most compelling epic to focus
                                        <b> "searching organic cosmetic products" </b> this is because one of the crucial tasks for Laura based on experience mapping.
                                        Therefore, I developed a <b>task flow </b> that helps me to follow a journey for the wireframes and prototype.

                                       Taking from the task flow, I began the fun part for me, <b>ideation and developing </b> mid-wireframes.
                                       After taking inspiration from the UI vision board, I sketched some solutions what it will look like the 
                                       app drafts.<br><br>
                                        My goal was to develop a simple and clear layout to help users easily find  an organic product and understand it. I made sketches on 
                                        task flow pages sequences from <b>homepage, search results,product page, ingredient page and cart page </b> with a sequence to order a product.<br><br>
                                       Moving from sketches to mid-wireframes, I modified them into a more suitable digital application.

                                      Before moving to do mockups, I focused on the usability issues for the prototype.
                                      I conducted usability testing in <b>2 rounds and 5 testers participated.</b><br><br>
                                      The goal was to find usability issues and then improve the website. I presented them 
                                      with tasks and a scenario.<br><br>

                                      <b><i>Scenario </i></b>: <br><br>
                                      Imagine that you are looking for a face moisturizer product that is vegan, cruelty-free and truly organic. As an ingredient-conscious person, you want to make sure that the product you already own is safe. <br><br>

                                    Transforming the app into more intuitive high-fidelity wireframes is where my creativity was free to shine. <br><br> The process of implementing visual design included experimenting with the colours, testing the accessibility and creating a UI library to maintain consistency. <br><br>
                                    
                                    The brand app values ethical beauty , organic and clean cosmetics. I decided on the name <b>Lotus </b>because it encompasses all the means that <thead>the brand tries to conceive. </thead> In Buddhism,  the white lotus flower means purity, and the red lotus means beauty, compassion and love.<br><br>
                
                                    For the app's colours, I opted for orange and green to reflect the colours of nature and organically inspired by plants and fruits such as papaya. Regarding the <b>wordmark and the app Icons, 
                                    </b> I have designed a simple wordmark using the "Lezetta" typeface. Where as the app icons is symboloysed by an orange lotus that's because is simply the brand identity.

                                    The outcome is the Lotus app, a digital solution to help users to shop ethically by easily searching for truly organic products that are partnered with the brands and read quickly  ingredients, scanning an organic product.
                                    The next will be implementing more iterations through usability testing to deliver the best user experience.<br><br>
                                     Alongside high-fidelity wireframes and the prototype, I designed a <b>marketing website. </b> The website aimed to attract users to download the Lotus app.<br>
