                                            Before developing the solution, I created a <b>User persona </b> for the Lotus app based on my findings in the previous step.
                                            To understand better the user experience when shopping online, I made a detailed <b>Experience Mapping</b> where I 
                                            identified opportunities to solve the problem.
                                            <br><br>

                                            Next, to help better emphasise with users I defined <b>Users stories</b> where I broaden it into 28 stories and 3 epics based on 
                                            the persona and the experience mapping. <br><br>
                                            The three main epics are <b>searching for organic cosmetic products, organic products label transparency and Shopping experience.</b>

                                        After authoring user stories, I selected the most compelling epic to focus
                                        <b> "searching organic cosmetic products" </b> this is because one of the crucial tasks for Laura is based on experience mapping.
                                        Therefore, I developed a <b>task flow </b> that helps me to follow a journey for the wireframes and prototype.
